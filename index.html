  <p class="ex1">
<pre id="Introduction_InText" class="ex1">
  The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires have highlighted the need for better monitoring and response strategies.
  Ground-based and satellite monitoring systems often face limitations in response time and accessibility in large and dense forested areas.
  However, due to the recent advancements in autonomous flight systems and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV’s) the monitoring of such events is being reshaped.
  Equipped with technologies to help wildfire monitoring such as thermal and multispectral imaging, UAVs can identify potential fire outbreaks through heat signatures,
  smoke and gas emissions, and even the dryness of the vegetation in the area. Along with artificial intelligence and machine learning, UAVs can operate autonomously without the guidance of humans.
  This article investigates the roles and potential of UAVs in wildfire monitoring, emphasizing key technological advancements and application areas. It explores the benefits of UAV swarm coordination for coverage,
  the integration of AI and learning algorithms to assist in the monitoring of wildfires along with monitoring the aftereffects of wildfires.

  Sensors such as thermal imaging cameras operate based on the principles of infrared radiation. All objects emit electromagnetic radiation which is proportional to their temperature as described by Planck’s law.
  Thermal cameras detect this radiation in the infrared spectrum (which are typically between 8-14 µm) and map it on a temperature map, allowing for UAVs to identify heat anomalies which are typical characteristics of potential fire outbreaks.
  To collect this data, UAVs must overcome the limitations associated to cameras in low visibility conditions and night operations (De Vivo, 2021, para. 2 of abstract).
  In addition to this, the computing cost due to image processing of the thermal imaging cameras in the majority of cases is associated with a dedicated Computer Processing Unit (CPU) which therefore means
  that the information has to then be relayed to a ground control station for processing (De Vivo, 2021, Fig. 1). Similarly, multispectral sensors utilise the principles of spectral reflectance.
  For example, vegetation absorbs light differently across different wavelengths due to their biochemical properties.
  These sensors measure the reflectance in specific areas, such as the infrared and red regions, to assess vegetation health and moisture levels.

  Autonomous navigation, UAV swarm coordination, and advanced processing algorithms are components that enhance the effectiveness of wildfire monitoring.
  Autonomous navigation relies on sensor inputs and computational models to allow UAVs to operate independently in environments with rugged terrains and dense forests.
  Techniques like simultaneous localization and mapping use GPS and LiDAR cameras to generate real-time 3D maps of the terrain in order to assist ground teams during wildfire operations, tracking the UAV’s location.
  UAV swarm coordination allows for multiple UAVs to coordinate during wildfire operations and traverse dense forested areas, compared to wheeled mobile robots,
  the high flexibility and manoeuverability of UAVs make them ideal platforms to perform autonomous tasks in extreme environments (Hu, 2022, Abstract).
  In addition, each UAV swarm operates independently without the reliance on a central command because of the guidance algorithms which allow for them to make crucial decisions while mapping out the environment as they have very high scalability and coverage.
  They also share data amongst each other such as the fire spread patterns and fire locations in real-time while relaying this information to ground teams and guiding them through the extreme hazards which can lower the risk of these missions to human life.
  Another reason why swarm coordination is better for these missions is that since there are multiple UAVs the sensor fusion approach improves the accuracy of fire detection,
  mapping, and environmental monitoring by integrating them through multiple UAVs enhancing the reliability of data.
  Multiple UAVs have to be used due to the limited field of vision in a single unmanned aerial vehicle in order to get multiple points of view which is especially needed when there is low visibility.

  Monitoring the air quality and the health of the terrain after a wildfire is very important as there are many pollutants which are released into the air such as carbon monoxide, organic compounds like VOCs, and greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.
  UAVs are equipped with gas sensors which can track and measure these emissions for atmospheric modeling and predict the spread of smoke and its potential impact on these regions.
  During active wildfires UAVs track the movement of smoke and other gases which help to predict where air quality may reach hazardous levels for ground teams.
  This is crucial as it can assist in evacuating and issuing public health warnings which can prove vital for elderly people with respiratory conditions and children.
  After a fire, UAVs continue to monitor air quality and assess the long-term environmental impacts due to residual gases, particulates such as (PM2.5 and PM10),
  and ash which can contaminate water and soil. The ability of UAVs to monitor air quality and assessment of environmental impacts after a wildfire improves our understanding of
  the long and short-term impacts of wildfires on ecosystems and human communities and in helping mitigate the environmental and public health consequences.

  In conclusion, due to recent advancements of autonomous flight systems and UAVS, wildfire monitoring has reached new heights with better levels of accuracy,
  adaptability, and efficiency thanks to technologies such as advanced thermal sensors, swarm coordination, autonomous navigation, machine learning models, and processing algorithms.
  The application of these technologies even extends further than active wildfires to monitor air quality, health of terrain which help assess the long and short-term environmental impacts from residual gases and particulate matter
  that can contaminate the water and soil. As climate change continues to increase the frequency and severity of wildfires, UAVs will play crutial roles in the future to come to mitigate the destructive impacts of wildfires on ecosystems and local communities.
